# About

Cohort-6 lab was created by Cohort-6  Software Engineers from the Alx Software engineering program.
Cohort-6 lab members are aspiring SE/pioneer SE

Thus to be more educated/talented in the field  of Software development/Engineering 
Dumka Bipnelo A member of alx Cohort-6 Software engineering program made a layout plan to
create a Group, and named it "Cohort-6" with the interest of his fellow alx Cohort-6 members(SE).

NB. Cohort-6 lab is not under the Alx Cohort_6 SE Program and Its Projects are not/we're not implemented by alx SE Program.
But Cohort-6 lab is in support of the alx SE Program. 
  Therefore Cohort-6 is a different community created from the Alx Software engineering program. 
  
  The main objectives of the Cohort-6 lab is to create sophisticated technologies with the help/ideas gotten from the Alx Software engineering program. Also creating an interactive Community for Software engineers in Africa and across the globe ðŸŒŽ 

The core concept of this repo "Cohort6-lab/web" is to organise code to be written by Cohort-6 lab Participants 
for the development for the official Cohort-6 lab website which will be a general platform for Cohort_6 lab Software engineers. Also this repo will serve as a support for Web Developers with open-source codes written and examined, 
to be used by web/web applications developers.
