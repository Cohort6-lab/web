# About

Cohort-6 lab was created by Cohort-6  Software Engineers from the Alx Software engineering program.
Cohort-6 lab members are aspiring SE/pioneer SE

Thus to be more educated/talented in the field  of Software development/Engineering 
Dumka Bipnelo A member of alx Cohort-6 Software engineering program made a layout plan to
create a Group, and named it "Cohort-6" with the interest of his fellow alx Cohort-6 members(SE).

NB. Cohort-6 lab is not under the Alx Cohort_6 SE Program and Its Projects are not/we're not implemented by alx SE Program.
But Cohort-6 lab is in support of the alx SE Program. 
  Therefore Cohort-6 is a different community created from the Alx Software engineering program. 
  
  The main objectives of the Cohort-6 lab is to create sophisticated technologies with the help/ideas gotten from the Alx Software engineering program. Also creating an interactive Community for Software engineers in Africa and across the globe ðŸŒŽ 

The core concept of this repo "Cohort6-lab/web" is to organise code to be written by Cohort-6 lab Participants 
for the development for the official Cohort-6 lab website which will be a general platform for Cohort_6 lab Software engineers. Also this repo will serve as a support for Web Developers with open-source codes written and examined, 
to be used by web/web applications developers.

#          Web Nomenclature 
The website for Cohort-6 Laboratory has been hosted on Awardspace 
and is currently on a sub-domain domain.
which means the website does not currently have a ssl or has not currently been certified.
Hosted for free on https://Awardspace.com with a Free DNS -sub-domain. Cohort-6 lab website is named 
 http://cohort-6.atwebpages.com where development will be ongoing.
 
 #      web Support 
 Since Cohort-6 lab website is currently hosted on a free platform. this webpage is only supported by Cohort6-lab contributors 
 
 
 # web Components
 NB. Changes made on this repo may not be subjected to http://cohort-6.atwebpages.com
 
 The Cohort-6 lab website is will be designed in 4 categories 
 
 ![Simple Family Tree](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71280190/161402170-c7311f74-3bf8-4537-8bd4-ebcf20ef1199.png)   

 C6-lab Structure.
 
 C6-lab Design.
 
 C6-lab Database.
 
 C6-lab Server.
 
C6-lab Structure : Consist of the web structure the basic implementation of C6 lab website in which HTML will be encoded (index.php) 
This file is opened to Frontend-Develops/Cohort-6 Aspiring frontend-dev (SE). mainly on HTML/HTML5.

C6-lab Design : C6 lab Design will be implemented on (style.css) file where CSS/CSS3 and React.JS Frameworks will be deployed. 
The development of this file is opened to Frontend-Develops/Cohort-6 Aspiring frontend-dev (SE).

Both index.php which contains HTML code and style.css which contains css files ðŸ“‚ are to synchronize to determine the User-Interface(UI) on C6-lab website.   
 

C6-lab Database/Server : This will be a center point for all Database configuration, Database info and db integration which will be embedded with servers side code -php (PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor  )  
PHP is a server side scripting language that is embedded in HTML, all file extention ends with php this is to ensure that backend programs are encrypted on C6-lab website. 
 
 C6-lab Website Database will be implemented with Mysql. and accessed with phpMyAdmin
 while php will be used to communicate with sql programs.
 
 The development of these files are opened to backend-developers/Cohort-6 Aspiring backend-dev (SE).
 
 
 
 NB. ALL files are opened to full-stack-developer(front-end/back-end Dev)/Cohort-6 Aspiring full-stack-developer and Software Developers.
 
 
 
 # file Naming/Organising
 
 cohort-6.atwebpages.com/index.php :   main file with includes HTML, Srcipts, Makes calls to Css code, php codes js libraries, meta links etc.  
 
 cohort-6.atwebpages.com/style.css :  sub-file which includes CSS3/CSS codes. 
 
 cohort-6.atwebpages.com/db.php   :   sub-file which includes php and sql codes  (database integration file) 

 other files : sub-files ðŸ“‚ are other multiple pages/ file this may include image files, user file, user-login file, login encrypted files and Document files .



# Workflow

Only recommend git commits made will be displayed on repo and tests will be made to ensure these changes work with already modified  files on the website to ensure smooth design / UI. 

Therefore a developer/aspiring dev can make changes to each file by editing that file from an IDE/Editor Eg. Vscode(recommend)  test these changes he/she has made on a browser then commit these changes to the repo .

The changes made will be diagnosed to ensure that all code/ files are synchronized and meet all requirements for a better webpage.  then successfully commits will be push to main and then integrated to the website 


NB. developer are to state there names at the end of the webpage edited/commited by them and all state the changes made on an edited page.
For a easier workflow and code view by moderators

ALWAYS Hashtag C6-lab on your changes 
Eg. #C6-lab 


# open-source 

C6-lab project is an open-source program but under the courtesy of cohort-6 S.E from alx SE program

Feel-FREE to explore, contribute and question ðŸ™‹
